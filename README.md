# arduino-mq7
CO measurement with Arduino UNO and MQ-7 sensor

This code uses the library: https://github.com/swatish17/MQ7-Library
In this setup the sensor is NOT calibrated and will have heavy fluctiations.

Optimize the setup using preheating of the sensor as explained in  http://www.areresearch.net/2017/03/detect-co-with-mq-7-sensor-module.html#comment-form
